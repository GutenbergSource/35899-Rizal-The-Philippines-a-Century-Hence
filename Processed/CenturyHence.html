<h2 class="main">Introduction</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As &ldquo;<span lang="es">Filipinas dentro de Cien
A&ntilde;os</span>&rdquo;, this article was originally published
serially in the Filipino fortnightly review &ldquo;<span lang="es">La
Solidaridad</span>&rdquo;, of Madrid, running through the issues from
September, 1889, to January, 1890.</p>
<p class="par">It supplements Rizal&rsquo;s great novel &ldquo;Noli Me
Tangere&rdquo; and its sequel &ldquo;El Filibusterismo&rdquo;, and the
translation here given is fortunately by Mr. Charles Derbyshire who in
his &ldquo;The Social Cancer&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Reign of
Greed&rdquo; has so happily rendered into English those masterpieces of
Rizal.</p>
<p class="par">The reference which Doctor Rizal makes to President
Harrison had in mind the grandson-of-his-grandfather&rsquo;s
blundering, wavering policy that, because of a groundless fear of
infringing the natives&rsquo; natural rights, put his country in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e280" href="#xd25e280" name=
"xd25e280">10</a>]</span>the false light of wanting to share in
Samoa&rsquo;s exploitation, taking the leonine portion, too, along with
Germany and England.</p>
<p class="par">Robert Louis Stevenson has told the story of the unhappy
condition created by that disastrous international agreement which was
achieved by the dissembling diplomats of greedy Europe flattering
unsophisticated America into believing that two monarchies
preponderating in an alliance with a republic would be fairer than the
republic acting unhampered.</p>
<p class="par">In its day the scheme was acclaimed by irrational
idealists as a triumph of American abnegation and an example of modern
altruism. It resulted that &ldquo;the international agreement&rdquo;
became a constant cause of international disagreements, as any student
of history could have foretold, until, disgusted and disillusioned, the
United States tardily recalled Washington&rsquo;s warning against
entanglements with foreign powers and became a party to a real
partition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e286" href="#xd25e286"
name="xd25e286">11</a>]</span>but this time playing the lamb&rsquo;s
part. England was compensated with concessions in other parts of the
world, the United States was &ldquo;given&rdquo; what it already held
under a cession twenty-seven years old,&mdash;and Germany took the rest
as her emperor had planned from the start.</p>
<p class="par">There is this Philippine bearing to the incident that
the same stripe of unpractical philanthropists, not discouraged at
having forced the Samoans under the ungentle German rule&mdash;for
their victims and not themselves suffer by their mistakes, are seeking
now the neutralization by international agreement of the Archipelago
for which Rizal gave his life. Their success would mean another
&ldquo;entangling alliance&rdquo; for the United States, with six
allies, or nine including Holland, China and Spain, if the &ldquo;great
republic&rdquo; should be allowed by the diplomats of the &ldquo;Great
Powers&rdquo; to invite these nonentities in world politics, with whom
she would still be outvoted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e290"
href="#xd25e290" name="xd25e290">12</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Rizal&rsquo;s reference to America as a possible factor
in the Philippines&rsquo; future is based upon the prediction of the
German traveller Feodor Jagor, who about 1860 spent a number of months
in the Islands and later published his observations, supplemented by
ten years of further study in European libraries and museums, as
&ldquo;Travels in the Philippines&rdquo;, to use the title of the
English translation,&mdash;a very poor one, by the way. Rizal read the
much better Spanish version while a student in the Ateneo de Manila,
from a copy supplied by Paciano Rizal Mercado who directed his younger
brother&rsquo;s political education and transferred to Jos&eacute; the
hopes which had been blighted for himself by the execution of his
beloved teacher, Father Burgos, in the Cavite alleged insurrection.</p>
<p class="par">Jagor&rsquo;s prophecy furnishes the explanation to
Rizal&rsquo;s public life. His policy of preparing his countrymen for
industrial and commercial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e295" href=
"#xd25e295" name="xd25e295">13</a>]</span>competition seems to have had
its inspiration in this reading done when he was a youth in years but
mature in fact through close contact with tragic public events as well
as with sensational private sorrows.</p>
<p class="par">When in Berlin, Doctor Rizal met Professor Jagor, and
the distinguished geographer and his youthful but brilliant admirer
became fast friends, often discussing how the progress of events was
bringing true the fortune for the Philippines which the knowledge of
its history and the acquaintance with its then condition had enabled
the trained observer to foretell with that same certainty that the
meteorologist foretells the morrow&rsquo;s weather.</p>
<p class="par">A like political acumen Rizal tried to develop in his
countrymen. He republished Morga&rsquo;s History (first published in
Mexico in 1609) to recall their past. Noli Me Tangere painted their
present, and in El Filibusterismo was <span class="corr" id="xd25e301"
title="Source: sketchod">sketched</span> the future which continuance
upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e304" href="#xd25e304" name=
"xd25e304">14</a>]</span>their then course must bring. &ldquo;The
Philippines A Century Hence&rdquo; suggests other possibilities, and
seems to have been the initial issue in the series of ten which Rizal
planned to print, one a year, to correct the misunderstanding of his
previous writings which had come from their being known mainly by the
extracts cited in the censors&rsquo; criticism.</p>
<p class="par">Jos&eacute; Rizal in life voiced the aspirations of his
countrymen and as the different elements in his divided native land
recognized that these were the essentials upon which all were agreed
and that their points of difference among themselves were not vital,
dissension disappeared and there came an united Philippines. Now, since
his death, the fact that both continental and insular Americans look to
him as their hero makes possible the hope that misunderstandings based
on differences as to details may cease when Filipinos recognize that
the American Government in the Philippines, properly approached, is
willing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e309" href="#xd25e309" name=
"xd25e309">15</a>]</span>to grant all that Rizal considered important,
and when Americans understand that the people of the Philippines,
unaccustomed to the frank discussions of democracy, would be content
with so little even as Rizal asked of Spain if only there were some
salve for their unwittingly wounded <i>amor propio</i>.</p>
<p class="par">A better knowledge of the writings of Jos&eacute; Rizal
may accomplish this desirable consummation. <span class=

F. Jagor: Berlin 1873</span>&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The old situation is no longer possible of
maintenance, with the changed conditions of the present time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The colony can no longer be kept secluded from
the world. Every facility afforded for commercial intercourse is a blow
to the old system, and a great step made in the direction of broad and
liberal reforms. The more foreign capital and foreign ideas and customs
are introduced, increasing the prosperity, enlightenment, and self
respect of the population, the more impatiently will the existing evils
be endured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;England can and does open her possessions
unconcernedly to the world. The British colonies are united to the
mother country by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>bond of mutual advantage, viz., the
production of raw material by means of English capital, and the
exchange of the same for English manufactures. The wealth of England is
so great, the organization of her commerce with the world so complete,
that nearly all the foreigners even in the British possessions are for
the most part agents for English business houses, which would scarcely
be affected, at least to any marked extent, by a political
dismemberment. It is entirely different with Spain, which possesses the
colony as an inherited property, and without the power of turning it to
any useful account.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Government monopolies rigorously maintained,
insolent disregard and neglect of the half-castes and powerful creoles,
and the example of the United States, were the chief reasons of the
downfall of the American possessions. The same causes threaten ruin to
the Philippines; but of the monopolies I have said enough. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Half-castes and creoles, it is true, are not, as
they formerly were in America, excluded from all official appointments;
but they feel deeply hurt and injured through the crowds of
place-hunters which the frequent changes of Ministers send to
Manila.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Also the influence of American elements is at
least discernible on the horizon, and will come more to the front as
the relations of the two countries grow closer. At present these are
still of little importance; in the meantime commerce follows its old
routes, which lead to England and the Atlantic ports of the Union.
Nevertheless, he who attempts to form a judgment as to the future
destiny of the Philippines cannot fix his gaze only on their relations
to Spain; he must also consider the mighty changes which within a few
decades are being effected on that side of our planet. For the first
time in the world&rsquo;s history, the gigantic nations on both sides
of a gigantic ocean are beginning to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>come into direct
intercourse: Russia, which alone is greater than two divisions of the
world together; China, which within her narrow bounds contains a third
of the human race; <i>America</i>, with cultivable soil enough to
support almost three times the entire population of the earth.
Russia&rsquo;s future r&ocirc;le in the Pacific Ocean at present
baffles all calculations. The intercourse of the two other powers will
probably have all the more important consequences when the adjustment
between the immeasurable necessity for human labor-power on the one
hand, and a correspondingly great surplus of that power on the other,
shall fall on it as a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The world of the ancients was confined to the
shores of the Mediterranean; and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans
sufficed at one time for our traffic. When first the shores of the
Pacific re-echoed with the sounds of active commerce, the trade of the
world and the history of the world may be really said to have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>begun. A start in that direction has been made;
whereas not so very long ago the immense ocean was one wide waste of
waters, traversed from both points only once a year. From 1603 to 1769
scarcely a ship had ever visited California, that wonderful country
which, twenty-five years ago, with the exception of a few places on the
coast, was an unknown wilderness, but which is now covered with
flourishing and prosperous towns and cities, divided from sea to sea by
a railway, and its capital already ranking among the world&rsquo;s
greatest seaports.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But in proportion as the commerce of the western
coast of America extends the influence of the American elements over
the South Sea, the ensnaring spell which the great republic exercises
over the Spanish colonies will not fail to assert itself in the
Philippines also. The Americans appear to be called upon to bring the
germ planted by the Spaniards to its full development. As conquerors of
the New World, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>representatives of the body of free citizens in
contradistinction to the nobility, they follow with the axe and plow of
the pioneer where the Spaniards had opened the way with cross and
sword. A considerable part of Spanish America already belongs to the
United States, and has, since that occurred, attained an importance
which could not have been anticipated either during Spanish rule or
during the anarchy which ensued after and from it. In the long run, the
Spanish system cannot prevail over the American. While the former
exhausts the colonies through direct appropriation of them to the
privileged classes, and the metropolis through the drain of its best
forces (with, besides, a feeble population), America draws to itself
the most energetic element from all lands; and these on her soil, free
from all trammels, and restlessly pushing forward, are continually
extending further her power and influence. The Philippines will so much
the less escape the influence of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>two great neighboring
empires, since neither the islands nor their metropolis are in a
condition of stable equilibrium. It seems desirable for the natives
that the opinions here expressed shall not too soon be realized as
facts, for their training thus far has not sufficiently prepared them
for success in the contest with those restless, active, most
inconsiderate peoples; they have dreamed away their youth.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Following our usual custom of facing squarely the
most difficult and delicate questions relating to the Philippines,
without weighing the consequences that our frankness may bring upon us,
we shall in the present article treat of their future.</p>
<p class="par">In order to read the destiny of a people, it is
necessary to open the book of its past, and this, for the Philippines,
may be reduced in general terms to what follows.</p>
<p class="par">Scarcely had they been attached to the Spanish crown
than they had to sustain with their blood and the efforts of their sons
the wars and ambitions of conquest of the Spanish people, and in these
struggles, in that terrible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>crisis when a people changes its form
of government, its laws, usages, customs, religion and beliefs the
Philippines were depopulated, impoverished and retarded&mdash;caught in
their metamorphosis, without confidence in their past, without faith in
their present and with no fond hope for the years to come. The former
rulers who had merely endeavored to secure the fear and submission of
their subjects, habituated by them to servitude, fell like leaves from
a dead tree, and the people, who had no love for them nor knew what
liberty was, easily changed masters, perhaps hoping to gain something
by the innovation.</p>
<p class="par">Then began a new era for the Filipinos. They gradually
lost their ancient traditions, their recollections&mdash;they forgot
their writings, their songs, their poetry, their laws, in order to
learn by heart other doctrines, which they did not understand, other
ethics, other tastes, different from those inspired in their race by
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>climate and their way of thinking. Then there was
a falling-off, they were lowered in their own eyes, they became ashamed
of what was distinctively their own, in order to admire and praise what
was foreign and incomprehensible: their spirit was broken and they
acquiesced.</p>
<p class="par">Thus years and centuries rolled on. Religious shows,
rites that caught the eye, songs, lights, images arrayed with gold,
worship in a strange language, legends, miracles and sermons,
hypnotized the already naturally superstitious spirit of the country,
but did not succeed in destroying it altogether, in spite of the whole
system afterwards developed and operated with unyielding tenacity.</p>
<p class="par">When the ethical abasement of the inhabitants had
reached this stage, when they had become disheartened and disgusted
with themselves, an effort was made to add the final stroke for
reducing so many dormant wills and intellects to nothingness, in order
to make of the individual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>a sort of toiler, a brute, a beast of
burden, and to develop a race without mind or heart. Then the end
sought was revealed, it was taken for granted, the race was insulted,
an effort was made to deny it every virtue, every human characteristic,
and there were even writers and priests who pushed the movement still
further by trying to deny to the natives of the country not only
capacity for virtue but also even the tendency to vice.</p>
<p class="par">Then this which they had thought would be death was sure
salvation. Some dying persons are restored to health by a heroic
remedy.</p>
<p class="par">So great endurance reached its climax with the insults,
and the lethargic spirit woke to life. His sensitiveness, the chief
trait of the native, was touched, and while he had had the forbearance
to suffer and die under a foreign flag, he had it not when they whom he
served repaid his sacrifices with insults and jests. Then he began to
study himself and to realize his misfortune. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>Those
who had not expected this result, like all despotic masters, regarded
as a wrong every complaint, every protest, and punished it with death,
endeavoring thus to stifle every cry of sorrow with blood, and they
made mistake after mistake.</p>
<p class="par">The spirit of the people was not thereby cowed, and even
though it had been awakened in only a few hearts, its flame
nevertheless was surely and consumingly propagated, thanks to abuses
and the stupid endeavors of certain classes to stifle noble and
generous sentiments. Thus when a flame catches a garment, fear and
confusion propagate it more and more, and each shake, each blow, is a
blast from the bellows to fan it into life.</p>
<p class="par">Undoubtedly during all this time there were not lacking
generous and noble spirits among the dominant race that tried to
struggle for the rights of humanity and justice, or sordid and cowardly
ones among the dominated that aided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>the debasement of their own
country. But both were exceptions and we are speaking in general
terms.</p>
<p class="par">Such is an outline of their past. We know their present.
Now, what will their future be?</p>
<p class="par">Will the Philippine Islands continue to be a Spanish
colony, and if so, what kind of colony? Will they become a province of
Spain, with or without autonomy? And to reach this stage, what kind of
sacrifices will have to be made?</p>
<p class="par">Will they be separated from the mother country to live
independently, to fall into the hands of other nations, or to ally
themselves with neighboring powers?</p>
<p class="par">It is impossible to reply to these questions, for to all
of them both <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> may be answered, according to the
time desired to be covered. When there is in nature no fixed condition,
how much less must there be in the life of a people, beings endowed
with mobility and movement! So it is that in order to deal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>with
these questions, it is necessary to presume an unlimited period of
time, and in accordance therewith try to forecast future events.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">What will become of the Philippines within a
century? Will they continue to be a Spanish colony?</p>
<p class="par">Had this question been asked three centuries ago, when
at Legazpi&rsquo;s death the Malayan Filipinos began to be gradually
undeceived and, finding the yoke heavy, tried in vain to shake it off,
without any doubt whatsoever the reply would have been easy. To a
spirit enthusiastic over the liberty of the country, to those
unconquerable Kagayanes who nourished within themselves the spirit of
the Magalats, to the descendants of the heroic Gat Pulintang and Gat
Salakab of the Province of Batangas, independence was assured, it was
merely a question <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>of getting together and making a determined
effort. But for him who, disillusioned by sad experience, saw
everywhere discord and disorder, apathy and brutalization in the lower
classes, discouragement and disunion in the upper, only one answer
presented itself, and it was: extend his hands to the chains, bow his
neck beneath the yoke and accept the future with the resignation of an
invalid who watches the leaves fall and foresees a long winter amid
whose snows he discerns the outlines of his grave. At that time discord
justified pessimism&mdash;but three centuries passed, the neck had
become accustomed to the yoke, and each new generation, begotten in
chains, was constantly better adapted to the new order of things.</p>
<p class="par">Now, then, are the Philippines in the same condition
they were three centuries ago?</p>
<p class="par">For the liberal Spaniards the ethical condition of the
people remains the same, that is, the native Filipinos have not
advanced; for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>friars and their followers the people have
been redeemed from savagery, that is, they have progressed; for many
Filipinos ethics, spirit and customs have decayed, as decay all the
good qualities of a people that falls into slavery that is, they have
retrograded.</p>
<p class="par">Laying aside these considerations, so as not to get away
from our subject, let us draw a brief parallel between the political
situation then and the situation at present, in order to see if what
was not possible at that time can be so now, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Let us pass over the loyalty the Filipinos may feel for
Spain; let us suppose for a moment, along with Spanish writers, that
there exist only motives for hatred and jealousy between the two races;
let us admit the assertions flaunted by many that three centuries of
domination have not awakened in the sensitive heart of the native a
single spark of affection or gratitude; and we may see whether or not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>the Spanish cause has gained ground in the
Islands.</p>
<p class="par">Formerly the Spanish authority was upheld among the
natives by a handful of soldiers, three to five hundred at most, many
of whom were engaged in trade and were scattered about not only in the
Islands but also among the neighboring nations, occupied in long wars
against the Mohammedans in the south, against the British and Dutch,
and ceaselessly harassed by Japanese, Chinese, or some tribe in the
interior<span class="corr" id="xd25e450" title="Not in source">.</span>
Then communication with Mexico and Spain was slow, rare and difficult;
frequent and violent the disturbances among the ruling powers in the
Islands, the treasury nearly always empty, and the life of the
colonists dependent upon one frail ship that handled the Chinese trade.
Then the seas in those regions were infested with pirates, all enemies
of the Spanish name, which was defended by an improvised fleet,
generally manned by rude adventurers, when not by foreigners and
enemies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>as happened in the expedition of G&oacute;mez
P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as, which was checked and frustrated by the
mutiny of the Chinese rowers, who killed him and thwarted all his plans
and schemes. Yet in spite of so many adverse circumstances the Spanish
authority has been upheld for more than three centuries and, though it
has been curtailed, still continues to rule the destinies of the
Philippine group.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, the present situation seems to be
gilded and rosy&mdash;as we might say, a beautiful morning compared to
the vexed and stormy night of the past. The material forces at the
disposal of the Spanish sovereign have now been trebled; the fleet
relatively improved; there is more organization in both civil and
military affairs; communication with the sovereign country is swifter
and surer; she has no enemies abroad; her possession is assured; and
the country dominated seems to have less spirit, less aspiration for
independence, a word that is to it almost incomprehensible. Everything
then at first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>glance presages another three centuries, at least,
of peaceful domination and tranquil suzerainty.</p>
<p class="par">But above the material considerations are arising
others, invisible, of an ethical nature, far more powerful and
transcendental.</p>
<p class="par">Orientals, and the Malays in particular, are a sensitive
people: delicacy of sentiment is predominant with them. Even now, in
spite of contact with the occidental nations, who have ideals different
from his, we see the Malayan Filipino sacrifice
everything&mdash;liberty, ease, welfare, name, for the sake of an
aspiration or a conceit, sometimes scientific, or of some other nature,
but at the least word which wounds his self-love he forgets all his
sacrifices, the labor expended, to treasure in his memory and never
forget the slight he thinks he has received.</p>
<p class="par">So the Philippine peoples have remained faithful during
three centuries, giving up their liberty and their independence,
sometimes dazzled by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>the hope of the Paradise promised, sometimes
cajoled by the friendship offered them by a noble and generous people
like the Spanish, sometimes also compelled by superiority of arms of
which they were ignorant and which timid spirits invested with a
mysterious character, or sometimes because the invading foreigner took
advantage of intestine feuds to step in as the peacemaker in discord
and thus later to dominate both parties and subject them to his
authority.</p>
<p class="par">Spanish domination once established, it was firmly
maintained, thanks to the attachment of the people, to their mutual
dissensions, and to the fact that the sensitive self-love of the native
had not yet been wounded. Then the people saw their own countrymen in
the higher ranks of the army, their general officers fighting beside
the heroes of Spain and sharing their laurels, begrudged neither
character, reputation nor consideration; then fidelity and attachment
to Spain, love of the fatherland, made of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>native,
<i>encomendero</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e474src" href="#xd25e474"
name="xd25e474src">1</a> and even general, as during the English
invasion; then there had not yet been invented the insulting and
ridiculous epithets with which recently the most laborious and painful
<span class="corr" id="xd25e483" title=
"Source: achievments">achievements</span> of the native leaders have
been stigmatized; not then had it become the fashion to insult and
slander in stereotyped phrase, in newspapers and books published with
governmental and superior ecclesiastical approval, the people that
paid, fought and poured out its blood for the Spanish name, nor was it
considered either noble or witty to offend a whole race, which was
forbidden to reply or defend itself; and if there were religious
hypochondriacs who in the leisure of their cloisters dared to write
against it, as did the Augustinian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>Gaspar de San Agustin and the
Jesuit Velarde, their loathsome abortions never saw the light, and
still less were they themselves rewarded with miters and raised to high
offices. True it is that neither were the natives of that time such as
we are now: three centuries of brutalization and obscurantism have
necessarily had some influence upon us, the most beautiful work of
divinity in the hands of certain artisans may finally be converted into
a caricature.</p>
<p class="par">The priests of that epoch, wishing to establish their
domination over the people, got in touch with it and made common cause
with it against the oppressive <i>encomenderos</i>. Naturally, the
people saw in them greater learning and some prestige and placed its
confidence in them, followed their advice, and listened to them even in
the darkest hours. If they wrote, they did so in defense of the rights
of the native and made his cry reach even to the distant steps of the
Throne. And not a few priests, both secular <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>and
regular, undertook dangerous journeys, as representatives of the
country, and this, along with the strict and public
<i>residencia</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e497src" href="#xd25e497"
name="xd25e497src">2</a> then required of the governing powers, from
the captain-general to the most insignificant official, rather consoled
and pacified the wounded spirits, satisfying, even though it were only
in form, all the malcontents.</p>
<p class="par">All this has passed away. The derisive laughter
penetrates like mortal poison into the heart of the native who pays and
suffers and it becomes more offensive the more immunity it enjoys. A
common sore, the general affront offered to a whole race, has wiped
away the old feuds among different provinces. The people no longer has
confidence in its former protectors, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>now its exploiters and
executioners. The masks have fallen. It has seen that the love and
piety of the past have come to resemble the devotion of a nurse who,
unable to live elsewhere, desires eternal infancy, eternal weakness,
for the child in order to go on drawing her wages and existing at its
expense; it has seen not only that she does not nourish it to make it
grow but that she poisons it to stunt its growth, and at the slightest
protest she flies into a rage! The ancient show of justice, the holy
<i>residencia</i>, has disappeared; confusion of ideas begins to
prevail; the regard shown for a governor-general, like La Torre,
becomes a crime in the government of his successor, sufficient to cause
the citizen to lose his liberty and his home; if he obey the order of
one official, as in the recent matter of admitting corpses into the
church, it is enough to have the obedient subject later harassed and
persecuted in every possible way; obligations and taxes increase
without thereby increasing rights, privileges <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>and
liberties or assuring the few in existence; a r&eacute;gime of
continual terror and uncertainty disturbs the minds, a r&eacute;gime
worse than a period of disorder, for the fears that the imagination
conjures up are generally greater than the reality; the country is
poor; the financial crisis through which it is passing is acute, and
every one points out with the finger the persons who are causing the
trouble, yet no one dares lay hands upon them!</p>
<p class="par">True it is that the Penal Code has come like a drop of
balm to such bitterness.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e517src" href=
"#xd25e517" name="xd25e517src">3</a> But of what use are all the codes
in the world, if by means of confidential reports, if for trifling
reasons, if through anonymous traitors any honest citizen may be exiled
or banished without a hearing, without a trial? Of what use is that
Penal Code, of what use is life, if there is no security in the home,
no faith in justice and confidence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>in tranquility of conscience? Of
what use is all that array of terms, all that collection of articles,
when the cowardly accusation of a traitor has more influence in the
timorous ears of the supreme autocrat than all the cries for
justice?</p>
<p class="par">If this state of affairs should continue, what will
become of the Philippines within a century?</p>
<p class="par">The batteries are gradually becoming charged and if the
prudence of the government does not provide an outlet for the currents
that are accumulating, some day the spark will be generated. This is
not the place to speak of what outcome such a deplorable conflict might
have, for it depends upon chance, upon the weapons and upon a thousand
circumstances which man can not foresee. But even though all the
advantage should be on the government&rsquo;s side and therefore the
probability of success, it would be a Pyrrhic victory, and no
government ought to desire such. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">If those who guide the destinies of the Philippines
remain obstinate, and instead of introducing reforms try to make the
condition of the country retrograde, to push their severity and
repression to extremes against the classes that suffer and think, they
are going to force the latter to venture and put into play the
wretchedness of an unquiet life, filled with privation and bitterness,
against the hope of securing something indefinite. What would be lost
in the struggle? Almost nothing: the life of the numerous <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e529" title="Source: dicontented">discontented</span>
classes has no such great attraction that it should be preferred to a
glorious death. It may indeed be a suicidal attempt&mdash;but then,
what? Would not a bloody chasm yawn between victors and vanquished, and
might not the latter with time and experience become equal in strength,
since they are superior in numbers, to their dominators? Who disputes
this? All the petty insurrections that have occurred in the Philippines
were the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>work of a few fanatics or discontented soldiers,
who had to deceive and humbug the people or avail themselves of their
power over their subordinates to gain their ends. So they all failed.
No insurrection had a popular character or was based on a need of the
whole race or fought for human rights or justice, so it left no
ineffaceable impressions, but rather when they saw that they had been
duped the people bound up their wounds and applauded the overthrow of
the disturbers of their peace! But what if the movement springs from
the people themselves and bases its cause upon their woes?</p>
<p class="par">So then, if the prudence and wise reforms of our
ministers do not find capable and determined interpreters among the
colonial governors and faithful perpetuators among those whom the
frequent political changes send to fill such a delicate post; if met
with the eternal <i>it is out of order</i>, proffered by the elements
who see their livelihood in the backwardness of their subjects;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>if just claims are to go unheeded, as being of a
subversive tendency; if the country is denied representation in the
Cortes and an authorized voice to cry out against all kinds of abuses,
which escape through the complexity of the laws; if, in short, the
system, prolific in results of alienating the good will of the natives,
is to continue, pricking his <i>apathetic</i> mind with insults and
charges of ingratitude, we can assert that in a few years the present
state of affairs will have been modified completely&mdash;and
inevitably. There now exists a factor which was formerly
lacking&mdash;the spirit of the nation has been aroused, and a common
misfortune, a common debasement, has united all the inhabitants of the
Islands. A numerous enlightened class now exists within and without the
Islands, a class created and continually augmented by the stupidity of
certain governing powers, which forces the inhabitants to leave the
country, to secure education abroad, and it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>maintained and struggles thanks to the
provocations and the system of espionage in vogue. This class, whose
number is cumulatively increasing, is in constant communication with
the rest of the Islands, and if today it constitutes only the brain of
the country in a few years it will form the whole nervous system and
manifest its existence in all its acts.</p>
<p class="par">Now, statecraft has various means at its disposal for
checking a people on the road to progress: the brutalization of the
masses through a caste addicted to the government, aristocratic, as in
the Dutch colonies, or theocratic, as in the Philippines; the
impoverishment of the country; the gradual extermination of the
inhabitants; and the fostering of feuds among the races.</p>
<p class="par">Brutalization of the Malayan Filipino has been
demonstrated to be impossible. In spite of the dark horde of friars, in
whose hands rests the instruction of youth, which miserably wastes
years and years in the <i>colleges</i>, issuing therefrom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>tired,
weary and disgusted with books; in spite of the censorship, which tries
to close every avenue to progress; in spite of all the pulpits,
confessionals, books and missals that inculcate hatred toward not only
all scientific knowledge but even toward the Spanish language itself;
in spite of this whole elaborate system perfected and tenaciously
operated by those who wish to keep the Islands in holy ignorance, there
exist writers, freethinkers, historians, philosophers, chemists,
physicians, artists and jurists. Enlightenment is spreading and the
persecution it suffers quickens it. No, the divine flame of thought is
inextinguishable in the Filipino people and somehow or other it will
shine forth and compel recognition. It is impossible to brutalize the
inhabitants of the Philippines!</p>
<p class="par">May poverty arrest their development?</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps, but it is a very dangerous means. Experience
has everywhere shown us and especially in the Philippines, that the
classes which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>are better off have always been addicted to peace
and order, because they live comparatively <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e562" title="Source: betare">better</span> and may be the losers
in civil disturbances<span class="corr" id="xd25e565" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Wealth brings with it refinement, the spirit
of conservation, while poverty inspires adventurous ideas, the desire
to change things, and has <span class="corr" id="xd25e568" title=
"Source: littles">little</span> care for life. Machiavelli himself held
this means of subjecting a people to be perilous, observing that loss
of welfare stirs up more obdurate enemies than loss of life. Moreover,
when there are wealth and abundance, there is less discontent, less
complaint, and the government, itself wealthier, has more means for
sustaining itself. On the other hand, there occurs in a poor country
what happens in a house where bread is wanting. And further, of what
use to the mother country would a poor and lean colony be?</p>
<p class="par">Neither is it possible gradually to exterminate the
inhabitants. The Philippine races, like all the Malays, do not succumb
before the foreigner, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>like the Australians, the Polynesians and the
Indians of the New World. In spite of the numerous wars the Filipinos
have had to carry on, in spite of the epidemics that have periodically
visited them, their number has trebled, as has that of the Malays of
Java and the Moluccas. The Filipino embraces civilization and lives and
thrives in every clime, in contact with every people. Rum, that poison
which exterminated the natives of the Pacific islands, has no power in
the Philippines, but, rather, comparison of their present condition
with that described by the early historians, makes it appear that the
Filipinos have grown soberer. The petty wars with the inhabitants of
the South consume only the soldiers, people who by their fidelity to
the Spanish flag, far from being a menace, are surely one of its
solidest supports.</p>
<p class="par">There remains the fostering of intestine feuds among the
provinces.</p>
<p class="par">This was formerly possible, when communication from one
island to another was rare and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>difficult, when there were no
steamers or telegraph-lines, when the regiments were formed according
to the various provinces, when some provinces were cajoled by awards of
privileges and honors and others were protected from the strongest. But
now that the privileges have disappeared, that through a spirit of
distrust the regiments have been reorganized, that the inhabitants move
from one island to another, communication and exchange of impressions
naturally increase, and as all see themselves threatened by the same
peril and wounded in the same feelings, they clasp hands and make
common cause. It is true that the union is not yet wholly perfected,
but to this end tend the measures of good government, the vexations to
which the townspeople are subjected, the frequent changes of officials,
the scarcity of centers of learning, which forces the youth of all the
Islands to come together and begin to get acquainted. The journeys to
Europe contribute not a little to tighten the bonds, for abroad the
inhabitants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>of the most widely separated provinces are
impressed by their patriotic feelings, from sailors even to the
wealthiest merchants, and at the sight of modern liberty and the memory
of the misfortunes of their country, they embrace and call one another
brothers.</p>
<p class="par">In short, then, the advancement and ethical progress of
the Philippines are inevitable, are decreed by fate.</p>
<p class="par">The Islands cannot remain in the condition they are
without requiring from the sovereign country more liberty <i>Mutatis
mutandis</i>. For new men, a new social order.</p>
<p class="par">To wish that the alleged child remain in its
swaddling-clothes is to risk that it may turn against its nurse and
flee, tearing away the old rags that bind it.</p>
<p class="par">The Philippines, then, will remain under Spanish
domination, but with more law and greater liberty, or they will declare
themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>independent, after steeping themselves and the
mother country in blood.</p>
<p class="par">As no one should desire or hope for such an unfortunate
rupture, which would be an evil for all and only the final argument in
the most desperate predicament, let us see by what forms of peaceful
evolution the Islands may remain subjected to the Spanish authority
with the very least detriment to the rights, interests and dignity of
both parties. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">If the Philippines must remain under the control
of Spain, they will necessarily have to be transformed in a political
sense, for the course of their history and the needs of their
inhabitants so require. This we demonstrated in the preceding
article.</p>
<p class="par">We also said that this transformation will be violent
and fatal if it proceeds from the ranks of the people, but peaceful and
fruitful if it emanate from the upper classes.</p>
<p class="par">Some governors have realized this truth, and, impelled
by their patriotism, have been trying to introduce needed reforms in
order to forestall events. But notwithstanding all that have been
ordered up to the present time, they have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>produced scanty results,
for the government as well as for the country. Even those that promised
only a happy issue have at times caused injury, for the simple reason
that they have been based upon unstable grounds.</p>
<p class="par">We said, and once more we repeat, and will ever assert,
that reforms which have a <i>palliative</i> character are not only
ineffectual but even prejudicial, when the government is confronted
with evils that must be cured <i>radically</i>. And were we not
convinced of the honesty and rectitude of some governors, we would be
tempted to say that all the partial reforms are only plasters and
salves of a physician who, not knowing how to cure the cancer, and not
daring to root it out, tries in this way to alleviate the
patient&rsquo;s sufferings or to temporize with the cowardice of the
timid and ignorant.</p>
<p class="par">All the reforms of our liberal ministers were, have
been, are, and will be good&mdash;when carried out. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When we think of them, we are reminded of the dieting of
Sancho Panza in his Barataria Island. He took his seat at a sumptuous
and well-appointed table &ldquo;covered with fruit and many varieties
of food differently prepared,&rdquo; but between the wretch&rsquo;s
mouth and each dish the physician Pedro Rezio interposed his wand,
saying, &ldquo;Take it away!&rdquo; The dish removed, Sancho was as
hungry as ever. True it is that the despotic Pedro Rezio gave reasons,
which seem to have been written by Cervantes especially for the
colonial administrations: &ldquo;You must not eat, Mr. Governor, except
according to the usage and custom of other islands where there are
governors.&rdquo; Something was found to be wrong with each dish: one
was too hot, another too moist, and so on, just like our Pedro Rezios
on both sides of the sea. Great good did his cook&rsquo;s skill do
Sancho!<a class="noteref" id="xd25e623src" href="#xd25e623" name=
"xd25e623src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">In the case of our country, the reforms take
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>the place of the dishes, the Philippines are
Sancho, while the part of the quack physician is played by many
persons, interested in not having the dishes touched, perhaps that they
may themselves get the benefit of them.</p>
<p class="par">The result is that the long-suffering Sancho, or the
Philippines, misses his liberty, rejects all government and ends up by
rebelling against his quack physician.</p>
<p class="par">In like manner, so long as the Philippines have no
liberty of the press, have no voice in the Cortes to make known to the
government and to the nation whether or not their decrees have been
duly obeyed, whether or not these benefit the country, all the able
efforts of the colonial ministers will meet the fate of the dishes in
Barataria island.</p>
<p class="par">The minister, then, who wants his reforms to be reforms,
must begin by declaring the press in the Philippines free and by
instituting Filipino delegates. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The press <span class="corr" id="xd25e643" title=
"Not in source">is</span> free in the Philippines, because their
complaints rarely ever reach the Peninsula, very rarely, and if they do
they are so secret, so mysterious, that no newspaper dares to publish
them, or if it does reproduce them, it does so tardily and badly.</p>
<p class="par">A government that <i>rules a country from a great
distance</i> is the one that has the most need for a free press, more
so even than the government of the home country, if it wishes to rule
rightly and fitly. The government that <i>governs in a country</i> may
even dispense with the press (if it can), because it is on the ground,
because it has eyes and ears, and because it directly observes what it
rules and administers. But the government that <i>governs from afar</i>
absolutely requires that the truth and the facts reach its knowledge by
every possible channel, so that it may weigh and estimate them better,
and this need increases when a country like the Philippines is
concerned, where the inhabitants speak and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>complain
in a language unknown to the authorities. To govern in any other way
may also be called governing, but it is to govern badly. It amounts to
pronouncing judgment after hearing only one of the parties; it is
steering a ship without reckoning its conditions, the state of the sea,
the reefs and shoals, the direction of the winds and currents. It is
managing a house by endeavoring merely to give it polish and a fine
appearance without watching the money-chest, without looking after the
servants and the members of the family.</p>
<p class="par">But routine is a declivity down which many governments
slide, and routine says that freedom of the press is dangerous. Let us
see what History says: uprisings and revolutions have always occurred
in countries tyrannized over, in countries where human thought and the
human heart have been forced to remain silent.</p>
<p class="par">If the great Napoleon had not tyrannized over the press,
perhaps it would have warned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>him of the peril into which he was
hurled and have made him understand that the people were weary and the
earth wanted peace. Perhaps his genius, instead of being dissipated in
foreign aggrandizement, would have become intensive in laboring to
strengthen his position and thus have assured it. Spain herself records
in her history more revolutions when the press was gagged. What
colonies have become independent while they have had a free press and
enjoyed liberty? Is it preferable to govern blindly or to govern with
ample knowledge?</p>
<p class="par">Some one will answer that in colonies with a free press,
the <i>prestige</i> of the rulers, that prop of false governments, will
be greatly imperiled. We answer that the prestige of the nation is
preferable to that of a few individuals. A nation acquires respect, not
by abetting and concealing abuses, but by rebuking and punishing them.
Moreover, to this prestige is applicable what Napoleon said about great
men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>and their valets. We, who endure and know all the
false pretensions and petty persecutions of those sham gods, do not
need a free press in order to recognize them; they have long ago lost
their prestige. The free press is needed by the government, the
government which still dreams of the prestige which it builds upon
mined ground.</p>
<p class="par">We say the same about the Filipino representatives.</p>
<p class="par">What risks does the government see in them? One of three
things: either that they will prove unruly, become political trimmers,
or act properly.</p>
<p class="par">Supposing that we should yield to the most absurd
pessimism and admit the insult, great for the Philippines, but still
greater for Spain, that all the representatives would be separatists
and that in all their contentions they would advocate separatist ideas:
does not a patriotic Spanish majority exist there, is there not present
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>there the vigilance of the governing powers to
combat and oppose such intentions? And would not this be better than
the discontent that ferments and expands in the secrecy of the home, in
the huts and in the fields? Certainly the Spanish people does not spare
its blood where patriotism is concerned, but would not a struggle of
principles in parliament be preferable to the exchange of shot in
swampy lands, three thousand leagues from home, in impenetrable
forests, under a burning sun or amid torrential rains? These pacific
struggles of ideas, besides being a thermometer for the government,
have the advantage of being cheap and glorious, because the Spanish
parliament especially abounds in oratorical paladins, invincible in
debate. Moreover, it is said that the Filipinos are indolent and
peaceful&mdash;then what need the government fear? Hasn&rsquo;t it any
influence in the elections? Frankly, it is a great compliment to the
separatists to fear them in the midst of the Cortes of the nation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">If they become political trimmers, as is to be expected
and as they probably will be, so much the better for the government and
so much the worse for their constituents. They would be a few more
favorable votes, and the government could laugh openly at the
separatists, if any there be.</p>
<p class="par">If they become what they should be, worthy, honest and
faithful to their trust, they will undoubtedly annoy an ignorant or
incapable minister with their questions, but they will help him to
govern and will be some more honorable figures among the
representatives of the nation.</p>
<p class="par">Now then, if the real objection to the Filipino
delegates is that they smell like Igorots, which so disturbed in open
Senate the doughty General Salamanca, then Don Sinibaldo de Mas, who
saw the Igorots in person and wanted to live with them, can affirm that
they will smell at worst like powder, and Se&ntilde;or Salamanca
undoubtedly has no fear of that odor. And if <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>this
were all, the Filipinos, who there in their own country are accustomed
to bathe every day, when they become representatives may give up such a
dirty custom, at least during the legislative session, so as not to
offend the delicate nostrils of the Salamancas with the odor of the
bath.</p>
<p class="par">It is useless to answer certain objections of some fine
writers regarding the rather brown skins and faces with somewhat wide
nostrils. Questions of taste are peculiar to each race. China, for
example, which has four hundred million inhabitants and a very ancient
civilization, considers all Europeans ugly and calls them
&ldquo;fan-kwai,&rdquo; or red devils. Its taste has a hundred million
more adherents than the European. Moreover, if this is the question, we
would have to admit the inferiority of the Latins, especially the
Spaniards, to the Saxons, who are much whiter.</p>
<p class="par">And so long as it is not asserted that the Spanish
parliament is an assemblage of Adonises, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>Antinouses, pretty boys,
and other like paragons; so long as the purpose of resorting thither is
to legislate and not to philosophize or to wander through imaginary
spheres, we maintain that the government ought not to pause at these
objections. Law has no skin, nor reason nostrils.</p>
<p class="par">So we see no serious reason why the Philippines may not
have representatives. By their institution many malcontents would be
silenced, and instead of blaming its troubles upon the government, as
now happens, the country would bear them better, for it could at least
complain and with its sons among its legislators would in a way become
responsible for their actions.</p>
<p class="par">We are not sure that we serve the true interests of our
country by asking for representatives. We know that the lack of
enlightenment, the indolence, the egotism of our fellow countrymen, and
the boldness, the cunning and the powerful methods of those who wish
their obscurantism, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span>may convert reform into a harmful instrument.
But we wish to be loyal to the government and we are pointing out to it
the road that appears best to us so that its efforts may not come to
grief, so that discontent may disappear. If after so just, as well as
necessary, a measure has been introduced, the Filipino people are so
stupid and weak that they are treacherous to their own interests, then
let the responsibility fall upon them, let them suffer all the
consequences. Every country gets the fate it deserves, and the
government can say that it has done its duty.</p>
<p class="par">These are the two fundamental reforms, which, properly
interpreted and applied, will dissipate all clouds, assure affection
toward Spain, and make all succeeding reforms fruitful. These are the
reforms <i>sine quibus non</i>.</p>
<p class="par">It is puerile to fear that independence may come through
them. The free press will keep the government in touch with public
opinion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>and the representatives, if they are, as they
ought to be, the best from among the sons of the Philippines, will be
their hostages. With no cause for discontent, how then attempt to stir
up the masses of the people?</p>
<p class="par">Likewise inadmissible is the objection offered by some
regarding the imperfect culture of the majority of the inhabitants.
Aside from the fact that it is not so imperfect as is averred, there is
no plausible reason why the ignorant and the defective (whether through
their own or another&rsquo;s fault) should be denied representation to
look after them and see that they are not abused. They are the very
ones who most need it. No one ceases to be a man, no one forfeits his
rights to civilization merely by being more or less uncultured, and
since the Filipino is regarded as a fit citizen when he is asked to pay
taxes or shed his blood to defend the fatherland, why must this fitness
be denied him when the question arises of granting him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>some
right? Moreover, how is he to be held responsible for his ignorance,
when it is acknowledged by all, friends and enemies, that his zeal for
learning is so great that even before the coming of the Spaniards every
one could read and write, and that we now see the humblest families
make enormous sacrifices in order that their children may become a
little enlightened, even to the extent of working as servants in order
to learn Spanish? How can the country be expected to become enlightened
under present conditions when we see all the decrees issued by the
government in favor of education meet with Pedro Rezios who prevent
execution thereof, because they have in their hands what they call
education? If the Filipino, then, is sufficiently intelligent to pay
taxes, he must also be able to choose and retain the one who looks
after him and his interests, with the product whereof he serves the
government of his nation. To reason otherwise is to reason stupidly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When the laws and the acts of officials are kept under
surveillance, the word justice may cease to be a colonial jest. The
thing that makes the English most respected in their possessions is
their strict and speedy justice, so that the inhabitants repose entire
confidence in the judges. Justice is the foremost virtue of the
civilizing races. It subdues the barbarous nations, while injustice
arouses the weakest.</p>
<p class="par">Offices and trusts should be awarded by competition,
publishing the work and the judgment thereon, so that there may be
stimulus and that discontent may not be bred. Then, if the native does
not shake off his <i>indolence</i> he can not complain when he sees all
the offices filled by <i>Castilas</i>.</p>
<p class="par">We presume that it will not be the Spaniard who fears to
enter into this contest, for thus will he be able to prove his
superiority by the superiority of intelligence. Although this is not
the custom in the sovereign country, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>should be practiced in
the colonies, for the reason that genuine prestige should be sought by
means of moral qualities, because the colonizers ought to be, or at
least to seem, upright, honest and intelligent, just as a man simulates
virtues when he deals with strangers. The offices and trusts so earned
will do away with arbitrary dismissal and develop employees and
officials capable and cognizant of their duties. The offices held by
natives, instead of endangering the Spanish domination, will merely
serve to assure it, for what interest would they have in converting the
sure and stable into the uncertain and problematical? The native is,
moreover, very fond of peace and prefers an humble present to a
brilliant future. Let the various Filipinos still holding office speak
in this matter; they are the most unshaken conservatives.</p>
<p class="par">We could add other minor reforms touching commerce,
agriculture, security of the individual <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>and of property,
education, and so on, but these are points with which we shall deal in
other articles. For the present we are satisfied with the outlines, and
no one can say that we ask too much.</p>
<p class="par">There will not be lacking critics to accuse us of
Utopianism: but what is Utopia? Utopia was a country imagined by Thomas
Moore, wherein existed universal suffrage, religious toleration, almost
complete abolition of the death penalty, and so on. When the book was
published these things were looked upon as dreams, impossibilities,
that is, Utopianism. Yet civilization has left the country of Utopia
far behind, the human will and conscience have worked greater miracles,
have abolished slavery and the death penalty for adultery&mdash;things
impossible for even Utopia itself!</p>
<p class="par">The French colonies have their representatives. The
question has also been raised in the English parliament of giving
representation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>to the Crown colonies, for the others already
enjoy some autonomy. The press there also is free. Only Spain, which in
the sixteenth century was the model nation in civilization, lags far
behind<span class="corr" id="xd25e741" title="Not in source">.</span>
Cuba and Porto Rico, whose inhabitants do not number a third of those
of the Philippines, and who have not made such sacrifices for Spain,
have numerous representatives. The Philippines in the early days had
theirs, who conferred with the King and the Pope on the needs of the
country. They had them in Spain&rsquo;s critical moments, when she
groaned under the Napoleonic yoke, and they did not take advantage of
the sovereign country&rsquo;s misfortune like other colonies, but
tightened more firmly the bonds that united them to the nation, giving
proofs of their loyalty; and they continued until many years later.
What crime have the Islands committed that they are deprived of their
rights?</p>
<p class="par">To recapitulate: the Philippines will remain Spanish, if
they enter upon the life of law and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>civilization, if the rights of
their inhabitants are respected, if the other rights due them are
granted, if the liberal policy of the government is carried out without
trickery or meanness, without subterfuges or false interpretations.</p>
<p class="par">Otherwise, if an attempt is made to see in the Islands a
lode to be exploited, a resource to satisfy ambitions, thus to relieve
the sovereign country of taxes, killing the goose that lays the golden
eggs and shutting its ears to all cries of reason, then, however great
may be the loyalty of the Filipinos, it will be impossible to hinder
the operations of the inexorable laws of history. Colonies established
to subserve the policy and the commerce of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e750" title="Source: soverign">sovereign</span> country, all
eventually become independent, said Bachelet, and before Bachelet all
the Ph&oelig;necian, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, English, Portuguese
and Spanish colonies had said it.</p>
<p class="par">Close indeed are the bonds that unite us to Spain. Two
peoples do not live for three centuries <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>in continual contact,
sharing the same lot, shedding their blood on the same fields, holding
the same beliefs, worshipping the same God, interchanging the same
ideas, but that ties are formed between them stronger than those
fashioned by arms or fear. Mutual sacrifices and benefits have
engendered affection. Machiavelli, the great reader of the human heart,
said: <i lang="it">la natura degli huomini, &eacute; cosi obligarsi per
li beneficii che essi fanno, come per quelli che essi ricevono</i> (it
is human nature to be bound as much by benefits conferred as by those
received). All this, and more, is true, but it is pure sentimentality,
and in the arena of politics stern necessity and interests prevail.
Howsoever much the Filipinos owe Spain, they can not be required to
forego their redemption, to have their liberal and enlightened sons
wander about in exile from their native land, the rudest aspirations
stifled in its atmosphere, the peaceful inhabitant living in constant
alarm, with the fortune <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>of the two peoples dependent upon the
whim of one man. Spain can not claim, not even in the name of God
himself, that six millions of people should be brutalized, exploited
and oppressed, denied light and the rights inherent to a human being,
and then heap upon them slights and insults. There is no claim of
gratitude that can excuse, there is not enough powder in the world to
justify, the offenses against the liberty of the individual, against
the sanctity of the home, against the laws, against peace and honor,
offenses that are committed there daily. There is no divinity that can
proclaim the sacrifice of our dearest affections, the sacrifice of the
family, the sacrileges and wrongs that are committed by persons who
have the name of God on their lips. No one can require an impossibility
of the Filipino people. The noble Spanish people, so jealous of its
rights and liberties, can not bid the Filipinos renounce theirs. A
people that prides itself on the glories of its past can not ask
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>another, trained by it, to accept abjection and
dishonor its own name!</p>
<p class="par">We who today are struggling by the legal and peaceful
means of debate so understand it, and with our gaze fixed upon our
ideals, shall not cease to plead our cause, without going beyond the
pale of the law, but if violence first silences us or we have the
misfortune to fall (which is possible, for we are mortal), then we do
not know what course will be taken by the numerous tendencies that will
rush in to occupy the places that we leave vacant.</p>
<p class="par">If what we desire is not realized....</p>
<p class="par">In contemplating such an unfortunate eventuality, we
must not turn away in horror, and so instead of closing our eyes we
will face what the future may bring. For this purpose, after throwing
the handful of dust due to Cerberus, let us frankly descend into the
abyss and sound its terrible mysteries. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">IV.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">History does not record in its annals any lasting
domination exercised by one people over another, of different race, of
diverse usages and customs, of opposite and divergent ideals.</p>
<p class="par">One of the two had to yield and succumb. Either the
foreigner was driven out, as happened in the case of the Carthaginians,
the Moors and the French in Spain, or else these autochthons had to
give way and perish, as was the case with the inhabitants of the New
World, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p class="par">One of the longest dominations was that of the Moors in
Spain, which lasted seven centuries. But, even though the conquerors
lived in the country conquered, even though the Peninsula <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>was
broken up into small states, which gradually emerged like little
islands in the midst of the great Saracen inundation, and in spite of
the chivalrous spirit, the gallantry and the religious toleration of
the califs, they were finally driven out after bloody and stubborn
conflicts, which formed the Spanish nation and created the Spain of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>
<p class="par">The existence of a foreign body within another endowed
with strength and activity is contrary to all natural and ethical laws.
Science teaches us that it is either assimilated, destroys the
organism, is eliminated or becomes encysted.</p>
<p class="par">Encystment of a conquering people is impossible, for it
signifies complete isolation, absolute inertia, debility in the
conquering element. Encystment thus means the tomb of the foreign
invader.</p>
<p class="par">Now, applying these considerations to the Philippines,
we must conclude, as a deduction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>from all we have said, that if
their population be not assimilated to the Spanish nation, if the
dominators do not enter into the spirit of their inhabitants, if
equable laws and free and liberal reforms do not make each forget that
they belong to different races, or if both peoples be not amalgamated
to constitute one mass, socially and politically homogeneous, that is,
not harassed by opposing tendencies and antagonistic ideas and
interests, some day the Philippines will fatally and infallibly declare
themselves independent. To this law of destiny can be opposed neither
Spanish patriotism, nor the love of all the Filipinos for Spain, nor
the doubtful future of dismemberment and intestine strife in the
Islands themselves. Necessity is the most powerful divinity the world
knows, and necessity is the resultant of physical forces set in
operation by ethical forces.</p>
<p class="par">We have said and statistics prove that it is impossible
to exterminate the Filipino people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>And even were it possible, what
interest would Spain have in the destruction of the inhabitants of a
country she can not populate or cultivate, whose climate is to a
certain extent disastrous to her? What good would the Philippines be
without the Filipinos? Quite otherwise, under her colonial system and
the transitory character of the Spaniards who go to the colonies, a
colony is so much the more useful and productive to her as it possesses
inhabitants and wealth. Moreover, in order to destroy the six million
Malays, even supposing them to be in their infancy and that they have
never learned to fight and defend themselves, Spain would have to
sacrifice at least a fourth of her population. This we commend to the
notice of the partizans of colonial exploitation.</p>
<p class="par">But nothing of this kind can happen. The menace is that
when the education and liberty necessary to human existence are denied
by Spain to the Filipinos, then they will seek <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>enlightenment abroad, behind the mother
country&rsquo;s back, or they will secure by hook or by crook some
advantages in their own country, with the result that the opposition of
purblind and paretic politicians will not only be futile but even
prejudicial, because it will convert motives for love and gratitude
into resentment and hatred.</p>
<p class="par">Hatred and resentment on one side, mistrust and anger on
the other, will finally result in a violent and terrible collision,
especially when there exist elements interested in having disturbances,
so that they may get something in the excitement, demonstrate their
mighty power, foster lamentations and recriminations, or employ violent
measures. It is to be expected that the government will triumph and be
generally (as is the custom) severe in punishment, either to teach a
stern lesson in order to vaunt its strength or even to revenge upon the
vanquished the spells of excitement and terror that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>the
danger caused it. An unavoidable concomitant of those catastrophes is
the accumulation of acts of injustice committed against the innocent
and peaceful inhabitants. Private reprisals, denunciations, despicable
accusations, resentments, covetousness, the opportune moment for
calumny, the haste and hurried procedure of the courts martial, the
pretext of the integrity of the fatherland and the safety of the state,
which cloaks and justifies everything, even for scrupulous minds, which
unfortunately are still rare, and above all the panic-stricken
timidity, the cowardice that battens upon the conquered&mdash;all these
things augment the severe measures and the number of the victims. The
result is that a chasm of blood is then opened between the two peoples,
that the wounded and the afflicted, instead of becoming fewer, are
increased, for to the families and friends of the guilty, who always
think the punishment excessive and the judge unjust, must be added the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>families and friends of the innocent, who see no
advantage in living and working submissively and peacefully. Note, too,
that if severe measures are dangerous in a nation made up of a
homogeneous population, the peril is increased a hundred-fold when the
government is formed of a race different from the governed. In the
former an injustice may still be ascribed to one man alone, to a
governor actuated by personal malice, and with the death of the tyrant
the victim is reconciled to the government of his nation. But in a
country dominated by a foreign race, even the justest act of severity
is construed as injustice and oppression, because it is ordered by a
foreigner, who is unsympathetic or is an enemy of the country, and the
offense hurts not only the victim but his entire race, because it is
not usually regarded as personal, and so the resentment naturally
spreads to the whole governing race and does not die out with the
offender. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Hence the great prudence and fine tact that should be
exercised by colonizing countries, and the fact that government regards
the colonies in general, and our colonial office in particular, as
training schools, contributes notably to the fulfillment of the great
law that the colonies sooner or later declare themselves
independent.</p>
<p class="par">Such is the descent down which the peoples are
precipitated. In proportion as they are bathed in blood and drenched in
tears and gall, the colony, if it has any vitality, learns how to
struggle and perfect itself in fighting, while the mother country,
whose colonial life depends upon peace and the submission of the
subjects, is constantly weakened, and, even though she make heroic
efforts, as her number is less and she has only a fictitious existence,
she finally perishes. She is like the rich voluptuary accustomed to be
waited upon by a crowd of servants toiling and planting for him, and
who, on the day his slaves refuse him obedience, as he does not live by
his own efforts, must die. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Reprisals, wrongs and suspicions on one part and on the
other the sentiment of patriotism and liberty, which is aroused in
these incessant conflicts, insurrections and uprisings, operate to
generalize the movement and one of the two peoples must succumb. The
struggle will be brief, for it will amount to a slavery much more cruel
than death for the people and to a dishonorable loss of prestige for
the dominator. One of the peoples must succumb.</p>
<p class="par">Spain, from the number of her inhabitants, from the
condition of her army and navy, from the distance she is situated from
the Islands, from her scanty knowledge of them, and from struggling
against a people whose love and good will she has alienated, will
necessarily have to give way, if she does not wish to risk not only her
other possessions and her future in Africa, but also her very
independence in Europe. All this at the cost of bloodshed and crime,
after mortal conflicts, murders, conflagrations, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>military executions, famine and misery.</p>
<p class="par">The Spaniard is gallant and patriotic, and sacrifices
everything, in favorable moments, for his country&rsquo;s good. He has
the intrepidity of his bull. The Filipino loves his country no less,
and although he is quieter, more peaceful, and with difficulty stirred
up, when he is once aroused he does not hesitate and for him the
struggle means death to one or the other combatant. He has all the
meekness and all the tenacity and ferocity of his carabao. Climate
affects bipeds in the same way that it does quadrupeds.</p>
<p class="par">The terrible lessons and the hard teachings that these
conflicts will have afforded the Filipinos will operate to improve and
strengthen their ethical nature. The Spain of the fifteenth century was
not the Spain of the eighth. With their bitter experience, instead of
intestine conflicts of some islands against others, as is generally
feared, they will extend mutual support, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>like shipwrecked
persons when they reach an island after a fearful night of storm. Nor
may it be said that we shall partake of the fate of the small American
republics. They achieved their independence easily, and their
inhabitants are animated by a different spirit from what the Filipinos
are. Besides, the danger of falling again into other hands, English or
German, for example, will force the Filipinos to be sensible and
prudent. Absence of any great preponderance of one race over the others
will free their imagination from all mad ambitions of domination, and
as the tendency of countries that have been tyrannized over, when they
once shake off the yoke, is to adopt the freest government, like a boy
leaving school, like the beat of the pendulum, by a law of reaction the
Islands will probably declare themselves a federal republic.</p>
<p class="par">If the Philippines secure their independence after
heroic and stubborn conflicts, they can <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>rest assured that
neither England, nor Germany, nor France, and still less Holland, will
dare to take up what Spain has been unable to hold. Within a few years
Africa will completely absorb the attention of the Europeans, and there
is no sensible nation which, in order to secure a group of poor and
hostile islands, will neglect the immense territory offered by the Dark
Continent, untouched, undeveloped and almost undefended. England has
enough colonies in the Orient and is not going to risk losing her
balance. She is not going to sacrifice her Indian Empire for the poor
Philippine Islands&mdash;if she had entertained such an intention she
would not have restored Manila in 1763, but would have kept some point
in the Philippines, whence she might gradually expand. Moreover, what
need has John Bull the trader to exhaust himself for the Philippines,
when he is already lord of the Orient, when he has there Singapore,
Hongkong and Shanghai? It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>probable that England will look
favorably upon the independence of the Philippines, for it will open
their ports to her and afford greater freedom to her commerce.
Furthermore, there exist in the United Kingdom tendencies and opinions
to the effect that she already has too many colonies, that they are
harmful, that they greatly weaken the sovereign country.</p>
<p class="par">For the same reasons Germany will not care to run any
risk, and because a scattering of her forces and a war in distant
countries will endanger her existence on the continent. Thus we see her
attitude, as much in the Pacific as in Africa, is confined to
conquering easy territory that belongs to nobody. Germany avoids any
foreign complications.</p>
<p class="par">France has enough to do and sees more of a future in
Tongking and China, besides the fact that the French spirit does not
shine in zeal for colonization. France loves glory, but the glory and
laurels that grow on the battlefields of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>Europe. The echo from
battlefields in the Far East hardly satisfies her craving for renown,
for it reaches her quite faintly. She has also other obligations, both
internally and on the continent.</p>
<p class="par">Holland is sensible and will be content to keep the
Moluccas and Java. Sumatra offers her a greater future than the
Philippines, whose seas and coasts have a sinister omen for Dutch
expeditions. Holland proceeds with great caution in Sumatra and Borneo,
from fear of losing everything.</p>
<p class="par">China will consider herself fortunate if she succeeds in
keeping herself intact and is not dismembered or partitioned among the
European powers that are colonizing the continent of Asia.</p>
<p class="par">The same is true of Japan. On the north she has Russia,
who envies and watches her; on the south England, with whom she is in
accord even to her official language. She is, moreover, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>under such diplomatic pressure from Europe that
she can not think of outside affairs until she is freed from it, which
will not be an easy matter. True it is that she has an excess of
population, but Korea attracts her more than the Philippines and is,
also, easier to seize.</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps the great American Republic, whose interests lie
in the Pacific and who has no hand in the spoliation of Africa, may
some day dream of foreign possession. This is not impossible, for the
example is contagious, covetousness and ambition are among the
strongest vices, and Harrison manifested something of this sort in the
Samoan question. But the Panama Canal is not opened nor the territory
of the States congested with inhabitants, and in case she should openly
attempt it the European powers would not allow her to proceed, for they
know very well that the appetite is sharpened by the first bites. North
America would be quite a troublesome rival, if she should once get into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>the business. Furthermore, this is contrary to
her traditions.</p>
<p class="par">Very likely the Philippines will defend with
inexpressible valor the liberty secured at the price of so much blood
and sacrifice. With the new men that will spring from their soil and
with the recollection of their past, they will perhaps strive to enter
freely upon the wide road of progress, and all will labor together to
strengthen their fatherland, both internally and externally, with the
same enthusiasm with which a youth falls again to tilling the land of
his ancestors, so long wasted and abandoned through the neglect of
those who have withheld it from him. Then the mines will be made to
give up their gold for relieving distress, iron for weapons, copper,
lead and coal. Perhaps the country will revive the maritime and
mercantile life for which the islanders are fitted by their nature,
ability and instincts, and once more free, like the bird that leaves
its cage, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>like the flower that unfolds to the air, will
recover the pristine virtues that are gradually dying out and will
again become addicted to peace&mdash;cheerful, happy, joyous,
hospitable and daring.</p>
<p class="par">These and many other things may come to pass within
something like a hundred years. But the most logical prognostication,
the prophecy based on the best probabilities, may err through remote
and insignificant causes. An octopus that seized Mark Antony&rsquo;s
ship altered the face of the world; a cross on Cavalry and a just man
nailed thereon changed the ethics of half the human race, and yet
before Christ, how many just men wrongfully perished and how many
crosses were raised on that hill! The death of the just sanctified his
work and made his teaching unanswerable. A sunken road at the battle of
Waterloo buried all the glories of two brilliant decades, the whole
Napoleonic world, and freed Europe. Upon what chance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>accidents will the destiny of the Philippines
depend?</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, it is not well to trust to accident, for
there is sometimes an imperceptible and incomprehensible logic in the
workings of history. Fortunately, peoples as well as governments are
subject to it.</p>
<p class="par">Therefore, we repeat, and we will ever repeat, while
there is time, that it is better to keep pace with the desires of a
people than to give way before them: the former begets sympathy and
love, the latter contempt and anger. Since it is necessary to grant six
million Filipinos their rights, so that they may be in fact Spaniards,
let the government grant these rights freely and spontaneously, without
damaging reservations, without irritating mistrust. We shall never tire
of repeating this while a ray of hope is left us, for we prefer this
unpleasant task to the need of some day saying to the mother country:
&ldquo;Spain, we have spent our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>youth in serving thy
interests in the interests of our country; we have looked to thee, we
have expended the whole light of our intellects, all the fervor and
enthusiasm of our hearts in working for the good of what was thine, to
draw from thee a glance of love, a liberal policy that would assure us
the peace of our native land and thy sway over loyal but unfortunate
islands! Spain, thou hast remained deaf, and, wrapped up in thy pride,
hast pursued thy fatal course and accused us of being traitors, merely
because we love our country, because we tell thee the truth and hate
all kinds of injustice. What dost thou wish us to tell our wretched
country, when it asks about the result of our efforts? Must we say to
it that, since for it we have lost everything&mdash;youth, future,
hope, peace, family; since in its service we have exhausted all the
resources of hope, all the disillusions of desire, it also <span class=

which we can not use, the blood from our veins and <span class=

<h2 class="main">Rizal&rsquo;s Farewell Address</h2>
<h2 class="main">Address to Some Filipinos</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Countrymen: On my return from Spain I
learned that my name had been in use, among some who were in arms, as a
war-cry. The news came as a painful surprise, but, believing it already
closed, I kept silent over an incident which I considered irremediable.
Now I notice indications of the disturbances continuing, and if any
still, in good or bad faith, are availing themselves of my name, to
stop this abuse and undeceive the unwary I hasten to address you these
lines that the truth may be known.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From the very beginning, when I first had notice
of what was being planned, I opposed it, and demonstrated its absolute
impossibility. This is the fact, and witnesses to my words are now
living. I was convinced that the scheme <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>was utterly absurd,
and, what was worse, would bring great suffering.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I did even more. When later, against my advice,
the movement materialized, of my own accord I offered not alone my good
offices, but my very life, and even my name, to be used in whatever way
might seem best, toward stifling the rebellion; for, convinced of the
ills which it would bring, I considered myself fortunate, if, at any
sacrifice, I could prevent such useless misfortunes. This equally is of
record. My countrymen, I have given proofs that I am one most anxious
for liberties for our country, and I am still desirous of them. <i>But
I place as a prior condition the education of the people</i>, that by
means of instruction and industry our country may have an individuality
of its own and make itself worthy of these liberties. I have
recommended in my writings the study of civic virtues, without which
there is no redemption. I have written likewise (and repeat my words)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>that reforms, to be beneficial, must come from
<i>above</i>, that those which come from below are irregularly gained
and uncertain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Holding these ideas, I cannot do less than
condemn, and I do condemn, this uprising,&mdash;as absurd, savage, and
plotted behind my back,&mdash;which dishonors us Filipinos and
discredits those who could plead our cause. I abhor its criminal
methods and disclaim all part in it, pitying from the bottom of my
heart the unwary who have been deceived.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Return, then, to your homes, and may God pardon
those who have worked in bad faith.</p>
<p class="par signed"><span class="sc">Jos&eacute; Rizal.</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fort Santiago, December 15th, 1896.</p>
<p class="par">The Spanish judge-advocate-general commented upon the
address:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The preceding address to his countrymen which Dr.
Rizal proposes to direct to them, is not in substance the patriotic
protest against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>separatist manifestations and tendencies
which ought to come from those who claim to be loyal sons of Spain.
According to his declarations, Don Jos&eacute; Rizal limits himself to
condemning the present insurrectionary movement as premature and
because he considers now its triumph impossible, but leaves it to be
inferred that the wished-for independence can be gained by procedures
less dishonorable than those now being followed by the rebels, when the
culture of the people shall be a most valuable asset for the combat and
guarantee its successful issue.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For Rizal the question is of opportuneness, not
of principles nor of aims. His manifesto might be summarized in these
words: &lsquo;Because of my proofs of the rebellion&rsquo;s certainty
to fail, lay down your arms, my countrymen. Later I shall lead you to
the Promised Land.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So far from being conducive to peace, it could
advance in the future the spirit of rebellion. For this reason the
publication of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>the proposed address seems impolitic, and I
would recommend to Your Excellency to forbid its being made public, but

selected from the junior Spanish army officers, risked the displeasure
of his superiors in the few words he did say, but his argument was
pitiably weak. The court scene, where Rizal sat for hours with his
elbows corded back of him while the crowd, unrebuked by the court,
clamored for his death, recalls the stories of the bloody assizes of
Judge Jeffreys and of the bloodthirsty tribunals of the Reign of
Terror. He was compelled to testify himself, was not permitted to hear
the testimony given for the prosecution, no witness dared favor him,
much less appear in his behalf, and his own brother had been tortured,
with the thumbscrews as well as in other mediaeval and modern ways, in
a vain endeavor to extort a confession implicating the Doctor.</i>

<h3 class="main">Additions to My Defence</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Don Jos&eacute; Rizal y Alonso respectfully
requests the Court Martial to consider well the following
circumstances:</p>
<p class="par">First.&mdash;Re the rebellion. From July 6th, 1892, I
had absolutely no connection with politics until July 1st of this year
when, advised by Don Pio Valenzuela that an uprising was proposed, I
counselled against it, trying to convince him with arguments. Don Pio
Valenzuela left me convinced apparently; so much so that instead of
later taking part in rebellion, he presented himself to the authorities
for pardon.</p>
<p class="par">Secondly<span class="corr" id="xd25e939" title=
"Source: :">.</span>&mdash;A proof that I maintained no political
relation with any one, and of the falsity of the statement that I was
in the habit of sending letters by my family, is the fact that it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>was necessary to send Don Pio Valenzuela under
an assumed name, at considerable cost, when in the same steamer were
travelling five members of my family besides two servants. If what has
been charged were true, what occasion was there for Don Pio to attract
the attention of any one and incur large expenses? Besides, the mere
fact of Sr. Valenzuela&rsquo;s coming to inform me of the rebellion
proves that I was not in correspondence with its promoters for if I had
been then I should have known of it, for making an uprising is a
sufficiently serious matter not to hide it from me. When they took the
step of sending Sr. Valenzuela, it proves that they were aware that I
knew nothing, that is to say, that I was not maintaining correspondence
with them. Another negative proof is that not a single letter of mine
can be shown.</p>
<p class="par">Thirdly<span class="corr" id="xd25e946" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&mdash;They cruelly abused my name and at the
last hour wanted to surprise me. Why did they not communicate with me
before? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>They might say likewise that I was, if not
content, at least resigned to my fate, for I had refused various
propositions which a number of people made me to rescue me from that
place. Only in these last months, in consequence of certain domestic
affairs, having had differences with a missionary padre, I had sought
to go as a volunteer to Cuba. Don Pio Valenzuela came to warn me that I
might put myself in security, because, according to him, it was
possible that they might compromise me. As I considered myself wholly
innocent and was not posted on the details of the movement (besides
that I had convinced Sr. Valenzuela) I took no precautions, but when
His Excellency, the Governor General, wrote me announcing my departure
for Cuba, I embarked at once, leaving all my affairs unattended to. And
yet I could have gone to another part or simply have staid in Dapitan
for His Excellency&rsquo;s letter was conditional. It
said&mdash;&ldquo;If you persist in your idea of going to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>Cuba, etc.&rdquo; When the uprising occurred it
found me on board the warship &ldquo;Castilla&rdquo;, and I offered
myself unconditionally to His Excellency. Twelve or <span class="corr"
id="xd25e953" title="Source: fourten">fourteen</span> days later I set
out for Europe, and had I had an uneasy conscience I should have tried
to escape in some port en route, especially Singapore, where I went
ashore and when other passengers who had passports for Spain staid
over. I had an easy conscience and hoped to go to Cuba.</p>
<p class="par">Fourthly.&mdash;In Dapitan I had boats and I was
permitted to make excursions along the coast and to the settlements,
absences which lasted as long as I wished, at times a week. If I had
still had intentions of political activity, I might have gotten away
even in the vintas of the Moros whom I knew in the settlements. Neither
would I have built my small hospital nor bought land nor invited my
family to live with me.</p>
<p class="par">Fifthly.&mdash;Some one has said that I was the chief.
What kind of a chief is he who is ignored <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>in the plotting and
who is notified only that he may escape? How is he chief who when he
says no, they say yes?</p>
<p class="par">&mdash;As to the &ldquo;Liga&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="par">Sixthly.&mdash;It is true that I drafted its By-Laws
whose aims were to promote commerce, industry, the arts,
etc<span class="corr" id="xd25e966" title="Not in source">.</span>, by
means of united action, as have testified witnesses not at all
prejudiced in my favor, rather the reverse.</p>
<p class="par">Seventhly<span class="corr" id="xd25e971" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&mdash;The &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; never came into
real existence nor ever got to working, since after the first meeting
no one paid any attention to it, because I was exiled a few days
later.</p>
<p class="par">Eighthly.&mdash;If it was reorganized nine months
afterwards by other persons, as now is said, I was ignorant of the
fact.</p>
<p class="par">Ninthly.&mdash;The &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; was not a society
with harmful tendencies and the proof is the fact that the radicals had
to leave it, organizing the Katipunan which was what answered their
purposes. Had the &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; lacked only a little of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>being adapted for rebellion, the radicals would
not have left it but simply would have modified it; besides, if, as
some allege, I am the chief, out of consideration for me and for the
prestige of my name, they would have retained the name of
&ldquo;Liga&rdquo;. Their having abandoned it, name and all, proves
clearly that they neither counted on me nor did the &ldquo;Liga&rdquo;
serve their purposes, otherwise they would not have made another
society when they had one already organized.</p>
<p class="par">Tenthly.&mdash;As to my letters, I beg of the court
that, if there are any bitter criticisms in them, it will consider the
circumstances under which they were written. Then we had been deprived
of our two dwellings, warehouses, lands, and besides all my
brothers-in-law and my brother were deported, in consequence of a suit
arising from an inquiry of the Administracion de Hacienda
(tax-collecting branch of the government), a case in which, according
to our attorney (in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>Madrid), Sr. Linares Rivas, we had the
right on our side.</p>
<p class="par">Eleventhly.&mdash;That I have endured exile without
complaint, not because of the charge alleged, for that was not true,
but for what I had been able to write. And ask the politico-military
commanders of the district where I resided of my conduct during these
four years of exile, of the town, even of the very missionary parish
priests despite my personal differences with one of them.</p>
<p class="par">Twelfthly.&mdash;All these facts and considerations
destroy the little-founded accusation of those who have testified
against me, with whom I have asked the Judge to be confronted. Is it
possible that in a single night I was able to line up all the
filibusterism, at a gathering which discussed commerce, etc., a
gathering which went no further for it died immediately afterwards? If
the few who were present had been influenced by my words they would not
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>let the &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; die. Is it that those
who formed part of the &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; that night founded the
Katipunan? I think not. Who went to Dapitan to interview me? Persons
entirely unknown to me. Why was not an acquaintance sent, in whom I
would have had more confidence? Because those acquainted with me knew
very well that I had forsaken politics or that, realizing my views on
rebellion, they must have refused to undertake a mission useless and
unpromising.</p>
<p class="par">I trust that by these considerations I have demonstrated
that neither did I found a society for revolutionary purposes, nor have
I taken part since in others, nor have I been concerned in the
rebellion, but that on the contrary I have been opposed to it, as the
making public of a private conversation has proven.</p>

<h2 class="main">Respecting the Rebellion.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">The remarks about the rebellion are from a
photographic copy of the pencil notes used by Rizal for his brief
speech. The manuscript is now in the possession of Sr. Eduardo Lete, of
Saragossa, Spain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I had no notice at all of what was being planned
until the first or second of July, in 1896, when Pio Valenzuela came to
see me, saying that an uprising was being arranged. I told him that it
was absurd, etc., etc. and he answered me that they could bear no more.
I advised him that they should have patience, etc., etc. He added then
that he had been sent because they had compassion of my life and that
probably it would compromise me. I replied that they should have
patience and that if anything happened to me I would then prove my
innocence. &ldquo;Besides, said I, don&rsquo;t consider me but our
country which is the one that will suffer.&rdquo; I went on to show how
absurd was the movement.&mdash;This later Pio Valenzuela
testified.&mdash;He did not tell me that my name was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>being used, neither did he suggest that I was
its chief, nor anything of that sort.</p>
<p class="par">Those who testify that I am the chief (which I do not
know nor do I know of having ever treated with them), what proofs do
they present of my having accepted this chiefship or that I was in
relations with them or with their society? Either they have made use of
my name for their own purposes or they have been deceived by others who
have. Where is the chief who dictates no order nor makes any
arrangement, who is not consulted in any way about so important an
enterprise until the last moment, and then, when he decides against it,
is disobeyed? Since the seventh of July of 1892 I have entirely ceased
political activity. It seems some have wished to avail themselves of my
name for their own ends. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
